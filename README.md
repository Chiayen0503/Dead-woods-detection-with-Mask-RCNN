# Dead woods detection with Mask RCNN 
This repository holds my final year in Lancaster University and dissertation project is extended from EU CanHeMon project.   

## Getting Started
The project will help you build your own synthetic data with annotations and train a Mask RCNN model in a tensorflow-gpu docker. You can also hire an EC2 accelerated computing instance which saves time on training models. For more information to set up AWS EC2 p3.2xlarge instance, please refer to:
